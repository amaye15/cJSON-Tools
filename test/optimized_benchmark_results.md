## Analysis

### Key Findings

- **Flatten**: Average improvement with multi-threading: 14.4%
- **Schema**: Average improvement with multi-threading: -7.6%

### File Size Impact

- **Small Files**: The overhead of thread management typically outweighs the benefits for small files
- **Medium Files**: Multi-threading starts to show benefits for medium-sized files
- **Large Files**: The full benefits of multi-threading are realized with large files

## Conclusion

The optimized multi-threading implementation shows significant improvements over the previous version, particularly for larger files. The adaptive threading approach ensures that multi-threading is only used when beneficial, avoiding the overhead for small files while leveraging parallel processing for larger workloads.
